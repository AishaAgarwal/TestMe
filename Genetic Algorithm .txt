It is a search huurstic algorithm which is inspired by charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. 
It reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation. 

Notion of Natural Selection - 

There are 5 phases for this - 
1- Initial Population 
2- Fitness Function 
3- Selection 
4- Crossover 
5- Mutation 

Initial Population - 

The process begins with a set of individuals which is called population .
An idividual is charachterised by a set of parameters (variables) known as genes. Genes are joined into a string to form a chromosome (solution). 
We encode the genes in a chromosome. 

Fitness Function - 

It determines how it an individual is. 
It gives a fitness score to each individual. The probability that an individual will be selected for reproduction is based on its fitness score. 

Selection - 

Select the fittest individuals and let them pass their genes to the new generation.

Crossover - 

It is the most significant phase.
For each pair of parents to be mated, a crossover point is chosen from within the genes. Offsprings are created by exchanging the genes of parents among themselves until the crossover point is reached. 
The new offsprings are added to the population. 

Mutation - 

Some of the bits in the bit string can be flipped. It occurs to maintain diversity within the population and prevent premature convergence. 

Termination - 

The process terminates if the population does not produce offspring which are significantly different from the previous generation.
